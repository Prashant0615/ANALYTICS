Smart Sales Insights: Predict, Analyze, Grow
üìä Project Overview
Smart Sales Insights is a data analytics project aimed at extracting actionable insights from a car sales dataset. This dataset captures key information about car listings, their condition, and sale performance. The project focuses on understanding trends, preparing clean data for analysis, and laying the foundation for predictive modeling.

üìÅ Dataset Description
The dataset includes detailed information on car sales transactions. Below are the features included:

Feature	Description
year	Year of manufacture
make	Car manufacturer (e.g., Toyota, Ford)
model	Specific model of the car
trim	Trim level or version (e.g., Sport, SE)
body	Body type (e.g., SUV, Sedan)
transmission	Type of transmission (Automatic, Manual)
vin	Vehicle Identification Number (unique ID)
state	U.S. state where the car was sold
condition	Condition score of the vehicle (numeric)
odometer	Mileage at the time of sale
color	Exterior color
interior	Interior type or color
seller	Dealership or seller name
mmr	Manheim Market Report price (estimated value)
sellingprice	Actual sale price of the vehicle
saledate	Date of the sale

‚úÖ Project Objectives
Data Cleaning & Missing Value Treatment

Identify and handle null or inconsistent data.

Standardize categorical values (e.g., colors, states).

Feature Selection & Engineering

Explore influence of odometer, condition, mmr, etc. on sellingprice.

Create new features (e.g., price difference = sellingprice - mmr).

Data Integrity & Consistency

Ensure correct formatting for saledate, vin, and numerical fields.

Remove duplicates or invalid VIN entries.

Summary Statistics & Descriptive Insights

Analyze average prices by brand, condition, and model year.

Understand mileage distributions and condition trends.

Trends, Patterns & Anomaly Detection

Identify seasonal trends using saledate.

Detect price anomalies and outlier records.

Outlier Handling & Data Transformation

Remove or cap extreme values in odometer, sellingprice, etc.

Apply transformations to normalize skewed features.

Visual Representations

Generate plots including:

Price distribution histograms

Odometer vs. selling price scatter plots

Time-series sales trends

Correlation heatmaps
